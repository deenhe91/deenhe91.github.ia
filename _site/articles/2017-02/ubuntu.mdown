  <article class="post-content">
    I have always had a macbook. When I was 17 I got my first, and it was a beautiful thing. After four years the poor thing couldn't take much more and I had to trade her in for a new shiny macbook air. Even more beautiful than the last (sorry, first) a well-oiled slick machine. The mac fantasy had consumed me and ruined me for anything else. However, there were little things that niggled. Apple in it's monopoly mania, could do as it pleased and a lot of the time, how it pleased did not please me. Especially after Jobbs died and they started closing doors. Impossible chargers that changed generation to generation, with a flimsy design that inevitably broke after the warranty and had to be replaced at extortionate prices. This closed off, something was not in alignment with my own tech beliefs and so when the battery on my matilda wore down and I was faced with replacing batteries on sluggish macs, buying a new one, or venturing off the beaten track into the world of windows, I chose the cheaper open-source option and bought an _Acer Swift3_.

## wipe the windows, please
Of course I couldn't very well work with windows. For so many reasons. When I started up the machine, I was immediately bombarded game icons. The lower bar had Netflix and Amazon icons and everything was in the wrong place. From a more techy perspective, blah blah blah

So I turned to Linux. I didn't know much about linux except that it was open source, and shared roots with apple software so that's a good start. I had a little experience with ubuntu so that's what I went for.
