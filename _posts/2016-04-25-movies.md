For our first solo project at the Metis bootcamp, we were told to work with scraping tools, movie data and linear regression.
Inspired by Matt Daniels and Hannah Anderson's [polygraph.cool](http://polygraph.cool/movies) Film Dialogue breakdown, I shaped my second Metis data project around their collected movie data. This data includes the number of lines spoken by male characters
in a collection of 2000 movies.

Matt Daniels and Hannah Anderson had already worked hella hard  and split the movie scripts by character _and_ by comparing to IMDB, assigned a sex and age to each character's actor/actress. The resulting metadata and some of the data is publicly available on Matt Daniels' github page for scrutiny and further data fun. 

I wanted to use all this lovely data to see whether it was possible to predict the year a movie came out in to based on it's character and line ratio. But I thought in order to do this effectively, I should probably include genre and for this I needed to scrape, scrape, scrape.

#### Web scraping with Beautiful Soup

I collected data on genre by scraping Box Office Mojo using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). I collected data on all the movies they have on the site. I actually also scraped info on budget and domestic gross in case I decided to use that later on. The data I needed was in a table. I looped through the `tr`s and filled in a pandas dataframe as I went. 

#### Data wrangling
Now I had all this data from Box Office Mojo and I only needed the genres for the movies from the polygraph movies. So I decided to join the two dataframes I now had using `pandas.merge`.

Merging the two dataframes together was annoying at first because movies will have the same title but come out in different years. Or the titles will be written slightly differently, and sometimes there were random dollar signs and other markings in the title that definitely did not belong there. _Oh the joys of data cleaning_. I wapped the year and title in a new column and merged the dataframes on that. This worked wonders except for one little movie, _Crash_, which according to IMDB came out in 2004 but in the dataset it came out in 2005. Whoops. Other than that the movies were solidly matched. 

I had to create dummy variables of the genres, which just creates a column for each genre and assigns a 1 if the movie is of that genre and a 0 if it's not. But I had 67 genres so this drastically enlarged my feature space and I didn't want to make life so difficult for myself.

To reduce the feature space, I condensed some of the more obscure genres into broader ones. Obscure meaning 'Comedy' was originally split into 'Comedy', 'Comedy/Drama', 'Comedy/Thriller', 'Comedy/Crime', etc. It was a little tricky sometimes, for example, does 'War Romance' go into 'War' or 'Romance'? In the end I manually condensed the genres, reducing the 67 genres to 10 using the pandas `replace` function.

The overlap between the 5117 scraped movies and the movies in the polygraphcool dataset was not very high, and I ended up with just 1198 movies which is a shame. I used pandas `df.intersection()` to find this overlap.

I added metrics for gender distribution. Just ratios of `total possible lines spoken/ male lines spoken`. This is a generous estimate as it provides the maximum possible ratio for non-male lines in the movie rather than an actual indication of non-male lines. Additionally, I added a ratio of how many of the 'lead characters' where non-male to male.

Just out of interest here is a scatter matrix of the relationships between parameters. The ratio here refers to lines spoken, not characters.

Unsurprisingly, there is a positive relationship between domestic gross and budget. The dataset contains far more movies that came out after the 1970s, and budget and domestic gross also show a positive relationship with year of release.

Interestingly, it does look like ratio of non-male to male lines increases over time. So that's exciting.


#### Model building

OK time for some models.
TEST/TRAIN????

I used the statsmodels package here, 

`import statsmodels.api as sm

model = sm.OLS(Y, X)
results = model.fit()
results.summary()`
