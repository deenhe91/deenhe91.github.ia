### OVERFISHING

here's a link to a pdf of the final presentation I gave on career day, 23rd June: [link.](https://github.com/deenhe91/fish_app/blob/master/fish_.pdf)

Overfishing is one of the biggest and most neglected issues of our time. The oceans play a crucial role in maintainig a stable atmosphere and also provide food for billions of people on earth. Maintaining a healthy ecosystem is important everywhere, but in the oceans, an unbalanced and collapsing ecosystem results in substantial effects on the levels of CO2 in our atmosphere and thus has catastrophic effects, not just for economies that rely on fishing to sustain them, but also for fish populations and ultimately our environment.

For our final project at Metis, I clustered fish species into levels of threat, and used these in an [app]
(github.com/deenhe91/fish_app) so that users can input the name of a fish and find out how threatened or overfished that species currently is.

I got my data from [NOAA](http://noaa.gov), which provided information on over 500 species of fish over an average of 60 years.

I also collected data from the [WCPFC](https://www.wcpfc.int) and did some analysis on that which I'll talk about later.


#### Exploratory Analysis

Amidst the many groupbys and pyplots a very clear pattern was demonstrated. Most of these fish were declining. Severely. It was actually quite shocking to view such an obvious trend. And with a bit of digging on the internet I found countless organisations, listed below, who are feverishly campiagning and recruiting to tackle these problems. 

The Seawatch app, this is very similar to what I have done, but with more time, money and manpower. However, they don't show the changes in the fish and this is a pretty useful chunk of information for the public to digest. It is far more impactful if someone says, "don't eat this fish, look here's why", than just, "don't eat this fish." In the same way you want to educate your children on _why_ they can't go around hitting things, or eat an entire bowl of haribo. That reaction to evidence stays an important influencer of our behaviour and in this way, data visualisations can be completely necessary.

So
