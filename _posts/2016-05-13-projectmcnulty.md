## Leaf Classifier

Perhaps the two biggest personal lessons I learnt at Metis were learnt during this project. 

#### First, procrastination will kill you. 
I did not know what to do. And I did not stick to any idea that I had. Initially we started in groups with vague aims of classifying a genre into a subgenre. We went to the spotify music hackathon, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and ready for adventure. Though the hackathon itself was fab and the speakers were inspiring - we didn't figure out our subgenre problem. The million song dataset wouldn't fit on my AWS, _and_ the spotify API didn't return the things that we were interested in. The fields were empty. Additionally, the awesome python libraries that we could use to analyse audio files was not cooperating with my python3. All of these barriers would have been circumventable if only I believed in the cause. I said yes to this because I was excited to work with music but I classifying genres into subgenres was not something I felt I could put my heart into. And so all of these hiccups felt all the more monumental. With retrospect I could have done some pretty neat classification problems surrounding music:

BOOM,

BOOM,

BOOM,

and I will probably explore these now I have some 'free' time (ahum. job-hunting.) but at the time these did not come to me. I looked up datasets and debated playing with calcium signalling data ([is a neuron of interest or not?] (http://neurofinder.codeneuro.org/)), or are mushrooms edible or not, or even does this person have Parkinson's or not? Some SUPER interesting things kicking about there but procrastination killed them all. And 36 hours before presentation time, I decided to classify leaf images to corresponding tree species. This was fine, but given the time strain I had very little opportunity to do deeper interesting analysis or to seriously consider the problem or uses of this classifier.

Moral of the story: Find a project and _stick to it_. You can make something interesting out of everything. 

####This ties in to the second lesson: Don't try and change the world with every project. 
You will __always__ be disappointed. __Always__. One of my main issues is having to make everything 
I have always appreciated the little things and I get excited by small logic problems and things like data cleaning (_HOW??_) but if I have to present a project I have had a tendency to overthink and search for the much much bigger picture. This has made it difficult to get excited about things that just have a simple bigger picture. Or projects that are only focused on 'increasing revenue'. But I have realised how detrimental this is. For the leaf project I went to lengths to make up a story about the APOCALYPSE! Are you ready?

_...it is 50 years in the future, and infrastructure has collapsed. It is more and more difficult to find reliable, safe and affordable medicine and so the people are turning back to nature for their remedies. For this reason they need a classifier to tell them, based on an image of the leaf, what the tree species is and whether that plant is medicinally useful to you..._

Yes. My fantastic teacher Vinny pointed out that actually we don't need an apocalyptic future to justify a leaf classifier and it can be useful for education, park rangers and many other things.
