## new year's resolutions

__"Pick a word! A word to live by for the coming year."__

Up until now, I have lived my live according to the opportunities that presented themselves, and what I felt like I would enjoy doing. It's why I picked my degree in Physiology, and promptly switched to Neuroscience. It's why I carried on my Neuroscience studies to Master's level. And it's how I landed my current job as a Data Scientist, something that is frequently met with the question, "So what does that have to do with Neuroscience?" from confused family members. It's the nice, accidental, gravitational stream of my life. I do it because I can, because the people who's opinions I care about will approve, and because it seems like not such a bad choice. I don't necessarily disagree with that way of living your life. But. I have now come to realise that there are places I want to be. Things I am truly passionate about that don't have to be confined to the 'hobby' corner of my life, and that the work I am doing now does not fulfill me. So I knew instantly when I was asked to pick a word that my answer was _"Deliberate. In 2017 I will be deliberate."_.

### two things you should know about the wiiise woman!
At school, or anywhere else for that matter, it was never made clear to us the extent and variation of work out there, or how we could go about finding the thing that would hit our buttons. Tickle our nips. It was doctor, lawyer, teacher, nurse, etc. Noble professions (some more than others) but it forced a lot of us to choose blindly, squeeze ourselves into boxes unfit. It has taken my entire education, three moves to different countries and 6 months of working in the corporate world to get some inkling of what it is that is important to me in work and money-making. I've known for a while that my profession needs to satisfy some underlying do-good-bug. But whether that was healthcare, LGBTQ rights, women's rights, or saving the oceans was unclear to me. They all rile me up. I want to spend hours in the dingy corners of pubs, over local brews, arguing over the ins and outs of holistic healthcare and feminism and overfishing and the sexual fluidity and on and on... but there is only one thing that has been a consistent pillar in my life. Something that I return to in every endeavour. And that, is the way we interact with the world we live in.

#### the environment

Environmental awareness has been at the forefront of my mind forever. My parents brought me up thinking about how we use energy, and the products and food we buy and what we use to clean the house, etc. The ever-present green around me has made conservation and nature a key part of my psyche and seeing the waste and ignorance around me is fantastic motivation to be more proactive in spreading the message. The conversation I had with someone at the NIPS conference last year, was one of a series of events that emphasised my need to contribute something more to our efforts in environmental conservation than just my own recycling and mindful diet. Connecting people to their environments through technology was a pretty promising and exciting idea.

#### communication is key

I have been writing stories and poems from the age of 6. Not surprising as I am borne of linguistical parents. My dad is a dutch author and radio man, and my mum is a dutch language and literature teacher. They were surprised at the scientific path I took but also pleased. Taking after my grandfathers, perhaps. The thing is, what I enjoyed most about my studies was writing essays, writing articles. Assessing how things were phrased, thinking critically about how the results were visualised and discussed. I have an ear for lyrics, I love books. I love writing this blog - which, amittedly started off as a project dump for the bootcamp but it has spiralled wildly out of control and is now a place where I solidify my thoughts into actual live-internet blog post creatures. The point is, communication is key. And whatever I delve into next, it must be heavily steeped in creative, effective and enjoyable communication.

Those are my two things. My points to which I will deliberately move in the coming months. _Do you know why you do what you do? Or why you don't do what you would do if you could do or should?_
