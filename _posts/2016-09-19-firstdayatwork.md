# today's the day

So guess what?! that take home challenge did the job and I am now a paid data scientist at Qlouder. Nice, eh?
Here starts a new journey. Although I will most definitely be incorporating my mad data knowledge into my work here, I also have a lot of development stuff to learn. And that journey of discovery is something I will be ardently documenting for your reading pleasure. And my own peace of mind. 

Of course I can't go blabbing about all the ins and outs of the top-secret projects I'll be working on, but I will be sharing some (starting off basic) things that I learn along the way. WOOP.
