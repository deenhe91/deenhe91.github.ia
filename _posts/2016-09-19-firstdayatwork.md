# today's the day

So guess what?! that take home challenge did the job and I am now a paid data scientist at Qlouder. Nice, eh?
Here starts a new journey. Although I will most definitely be incorporating my mad data knowledge into my work here, I also have a lot of development stuff to learn. And that journey of discovery is something I will be documenting for your reading pleasure. And my own peace of mind.
