## NIPS 

As the Magic conference rounds up on Sunday evening at the CCIB in Barcelona, leagues of nerds arrive to register for the 2016 NIPS conference. As was driven home at the intro talks, the conference has close to doubled in size from last year with a total of 6000 attendees. I collect my badge, my name spelled correctly - a surprisingly difficult task to achieve, I've learnt from many mispelled coffee cups and name tags throughout my life - and I am ready. To my delight, the giant, edgy conference centre is minutes away from the sparkling mediterranean sea front.

The mix of people is surprising. There is definitely an air of fandom in the building, especially when people like Yan Le Cun stroll through, wearing the same badge we all do. It feels like a movie star has entered the building, people honing in him from all corners of the room to express their admiration. The range in age, race and industry is quite astonishing. Even the sex divide is shrinking with 900 of the 6000 being women it doesn't feel as much as a boy's club as it did. The old timers, men and women who have been in the field since the birth of deep learning in the 80s are here; as are some high school kids, who, enamoured with TensorFlow, wanted to come and see their dreams turned to reality. 

The field is so broad, and the conference getting so big, that it was argued that perhaps we needed individual conferences for more specific topics. NIPS Health, NIPS Theory, NIPS NLP, NIPS Vision, so the list goes on. But one of the main attractions of this conference is it's interdisciplinarity. I had lunch with neuroscientists, ecologists, mathmeticians, physicists and risk management analysts. It was fascinating to sit with these people and hear what they had to say about machine learning. Of course you can attend the conference and pick and choose subject matter in depth, like a specialist update, _or_ you can go and get a broader understanding of just how relevant machine learning and neural nets are to just about every field out there. Except conservation. 

This, for me, was a massive drawback and I hope that more attention will be given to the power of machine learning and technology in the eco-driven sectors. Whether it's detecting poaching, illegal overfishing, or building algorithms that classify bird calls so you can collect biodiversity data by having sensors in gardens and national parks, the potential for machine learning in conservation is significant and should be given the space. NIPS was largely focused on theory and technique, it is afterall, a showcase of the latest and greatest in information processing research so not an application-based conference in any sense. However, there were definite themes that grabbed the spotlight (healthcare, image generation, robotics), so why there was no attention given to eco-related machine learning is beyond me. 

Despite this, it is a conference worth attending for anyone with an interest in machine learning, and a testament to it's success in multiple areas.
