# Big

To celebrate making it to the course halfway point, my glorious fiance took me on a spontaneous night bus
to Montreal. First time in Canada for me and the european taste of the place took me by surprise and made
me crave the streets of Amsterdam, Paris, Madrid, Rejkyavik... Nonetheless, the place is screaming with it's own identity, and it's not confused by any means. I'll definitely be scooting on over up here whenever I can to spend
a little more time on these canado-european streets.
